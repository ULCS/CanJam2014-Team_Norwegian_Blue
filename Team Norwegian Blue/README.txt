Description:
	In this game, you play the role of a Russian commissar who loves war and destruction
	(not unlike Apocalypse Now's Colonel Kilgore). You have been sent to invade the countryside
	of Ukraine and you plan to destroy as much of the natural beauty as possible as you do so.
	Command your troops to use their rifles and flamethrowers to blight the land and destroy the
	enemy troops. However, your subordinates aren't as in love with war as you are, and require
	encouragement or 'encouragement' to raise their morale.

	As the Commissar, you can motivate your troops using either a Rousing Speech (Hold Q) or an
	Execution (E with a friendly soldier selected). However, both these abilities have a short
	effect range and you may need multiple attempts to properly motivate your troops. The stars
	above your troops' heads show their morale (outer star, yellow for respect, red for fear)
	and health (inner star, green for full health, red for low health).

	With your troops motivated, you can use R and F to command nearby troops to attack selected
	targets with Rifles or Flamethrowers respectively. However, their morale will decrease as they
	destroy everything.

	Additionally, you can convert hostile troops using your rousing speeches, or cause them to give
	up by ruining their land.
